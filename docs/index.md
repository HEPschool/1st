## Monthly Graduate-Student Workshop on High-Energy Phenomenology

A student-led monthly workshop where graduate students give field-building talks in their research areas, focusing on the big picture, standard tools, and current status. Speakers use each session to firm up the fundamentals in their own field: core concepts, canonical models, and standard computations. The audience, in turn, builds cross-field literacy that directly benefits conference participation and collaborative projects.
